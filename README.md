# Bank Account
## Description
- This is a basic bank account program that allows someone to open a new account and be able to deposit, withdraw, and check their account balance.
  - The user is prompted to give their name and an initial balance (must be greater than 0). This is used to create a new BankAccount() object.
  - The user is then able to deposit, withdraw, or check their balance. All deposits and withdrawals must be greater than 0.
  - Withdrawals will be denied if an amount greater than the balance in the account is inputed.
  - The user can quit the program after opening a new account.
